# SiteGenesis-Community-TestSuite

The test suite focuses on functional frontend testing. It was build and may be run with __XLT Script Developer__ in Firefox or the __XLT Framework__ by orchestrating different WebDrivers. 

As test suites sometimes tend to become complex and hard to maintain we realized it is time to build a clearly structured test suite with a well-defined set of tests. This test suite is based on testing the storefront of the demo shop __Demandware__ __SiteGenesis__ but the underlying concepts and the communicated know-how are valid for building test suites of other web applications as well. Everybody is invited to use it, learn from it, improve it and adapt it to their needs. Possible purposes encompass:

- Initial test suite to automate new shops based on SiteGenesis.
- Demonstration of test automation and test suite structuring.
- Entry point for test development with fast learning curve.
- Reuse of collected best practises in other (existing) projects.

## Test Suite Documentation

Please visit the generated [ScriptDoc](http://dataduke.github.io/xlt-testsuite-documentation/scriptdoc/index.html) for extended information on test data, packages, test cases and modules. The provided [Guide](https://github.com/dataduke/xlt-testsuite-documentation/blob/gh-pages/GUIDE.md) delivers instructions for test suite development, conventions for test suite styling and pointers to other helpful resources.

## Test Suite Backlog

All planned features are publicly tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Xceptance/SiteGenesis-Community-TestSuite/issues). Feel free to add feature requests!

(__Important notice:__Please only use the version from our company website and __not__ the outdated version from Firefox Add-ons directory.)
- Install Firefox add-on `XLT Script Developer`.
- Open `Tools > XLT Script Developer` in Firefox.
- Import this test suite by clicking the `folder` icon above the navigation panel.
- Set the `storefront_url` of the **SiteGenesis** system under test in `XLT Scipt Developer > Manage Global Test Data`.
- Open a test case in the navigaton panel and click the replay button in the toolbar.

### [XLT Framework](https://lab.xceptance.de/releases/xlt/4.4.5/xlt-4.4.5.zip)

#### Prerequisites

- XLT&reg; Framework v4.5.0 (or higher)
- JDK 7 Update 75 (or higher)
- Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse, IDEA, NetBeans)

#### Installation

- [Download the XLT Framework](https://www.xceptance.com/en/xlt/download.html) and unzip this test suite in a directory of your choice.
- Import test suite as new Java project (with JDK runtime).
- Import XLT libraries.
- Edit configuration see below.
- Run test as JUnit test (default configuration: Firefox WebDriver).
- Adapt WebDriver configurations in `project.properties` if you like.

### [Test Data](http://dataduke.github.io/xlt-testsuite-documentation/scriptdoc/testdata.html)

As input a test can use test data placed in seperate files on global, package or test layer. Test data defined inside - at the test case - overwrites test data from outside (anti-hierachical handling).

### [Packages](http://dataduke.github.io/xlt-testsuite-documentation/scriptdoc/packages.html)

__Packages__ form the main tree structure of the test suite. Each package may consists of other subpackages (layers) and contains test cases (named `tests.subpackage`), script modules (named `modules.subpackage`) or optional Java modules. The file system implements them as folders. 

### [Tests](http://dataduke.github.io/xlt-testsuite-documentation/scriptdoc/tests.html)

Every __test case__ or short _test_ (named `T...`) simulates a shop visit of a customer. A test focuses on a specific process part of the shop visit which is tested in depth. This test focus is assigned to a determined shop area. Every shop area has its own package (folder) so that each test can be filed. The aim of our test set is to cover standard functions of the shop system. This means all tests have to cover a wide variety of different test pathes.

A test is build up on script modules. Each test consists of test setup (ensuring preconditions), test scope (focusing on relevant test steps) and test teardown (cleaning up of browser data).

### [Modules](http://dataduke.github.io/xlt-testsuite-documentation/scriptdoc/modules.html)

A __script module__ or short __module__ (named `M...`), contains actions, commands and comments. Most modules interact with elements of a specifc webpage. Thus it makes sense to structured them by their according pages. Each module can be reused by different tests.

__Validation Modules__ (named `V...`): Validation of webpage elements and dynamic data is a very essential part of testing. Hence these special modules evalute that a needed fit criterion is met (mostly via assertions).

__Flow Modules__ (named `F...`): Some modules mimic more sophisticated shopping behaviours by interacting with several pages in a flow. The achieved specific goal at the end of the process is of most importance (in contrast to the taken singular steps). Flows often reuse other modules and allow a compact test structure. Examples: Add a basic product to cart; Create a new customer; Add an address to a customer; Check order status in order history.

There are also some global modules (for interactions with elements in header, footer or naviagtion) and helper modules (enabling text conversions for example).
