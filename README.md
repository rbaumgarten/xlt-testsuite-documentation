# SiteGenesis-Community-TestSuite

The test suite was build and can be run with the __XLT Script Developer__ in Firefox and the __XLT Framework__ with different WebDriversf . The intention encompasses collecting experiences, consolidating knowledge and sharing ideas of testing practises. This project is based on the demo shop __Demandware__ __SiteGenesis__ but the underlying concepts and the communicated know-how are valid for building test suites of other web applications as well.

## System Prerequisites

To run the test suite with the __XLT Script Developer__ in Firefox you only need:

- Firefox
- XLT Script Developer v4.5.0 or higher: [Download](https://www.xceptance.com/en/xlt/download.html)
- [Demandware](http://www.demandware.com/) [SiteGenesis](ttp://www.demandware.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SiteGenesis-Site) v15.1.0.14 or higher

To run the test suite with the __XLT Framework__ you also need:

- XLT&reg;: [Download](https://www.xceptance.com/en/xlt/download.html)
- JDK
- Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse, IDEA, NetBeans)

## Installation

- Download and unzip the test suite in a directory of your choice.

To run the test suite with the __XLT Script Developer__ in Firefox you only need:

- Install Firefox add-on `XLT Script Developer`.
- Open `Tools > XLT Script Developer` in Firefox.
- Import this test suite by clicking the `folder` icon above the navigation panel.
- `XLT Scipt Developer > Manage Global Test Data` set the **SiteGenesis** `storefront_url`.
- Open a test case in the navigaton panel and click replay button in toolbar.

To run the test suite with the __XLT Framework__ you also need:

- Import test suite as new Java project (with JDK runtime).
- Import XLT libraries.
- Edit configuration see below.
- Run test as JUnit test (default configuration: Firefox WebDriver).
- Adapt WebDriver configurations in `project.properties` if you like.

## Project Idea

As there are complex test suites (including SiteGenesis) we realized it is time to bundle the collected testing know-how by building a small and clearly structured test suite to showcase best practises with a well-defined set of tests. Everybody is invited to use it, learn from it, improve it and adapt it to their needs.

## Use Cases

The test suite is a handy reference for everybody interested in test automation:

Introduction:
 
- demonstrate test automation and structure
- use it as entry point with fast learning curve

Existing Projects:

- serve as collection of examples and show cases
- reuse best practises for QA of other projects 

New Projects:

- utilize for initial test automation of new shop projects based on SiteGenesis

## Feature Backlog

All planned features are tracked as issues of this GitHub repository.

## Description
