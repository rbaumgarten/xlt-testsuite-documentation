# SiteGenesis-Community-TestSuite

The test suite focuses on functional frontend blackbox regression testing. It was build and may be run with the __XLT Script Developer__ in Firefox and the __XLT Framework__ by orchestrating different WebDrivers. 

As there are already many complex test suites (including some for SiteGenesis) we realized it is time to build a small and clearly structured test suite to showcase best practises with a well-defined set of tests. Thus the project idea is to collect experiences, consolidate knowledge and share ideas of testing practises. 

This test suite is based on testing the storefront of the demo shop __Demandware__ __SiteGenesis__ but the underlying concepts and the communicated know-how are valid for building test suites of other web applications as well. Everybody is invited to use it, learn from it, improve it and adapt it to their needs. Possible purposes encompass:

- Demonstration of test automation and test suite structuring.
- Entry point for test development with fast learning curve.
- Reuse of collected best practises in other (existing) projects.
- Initial test suite to automate new shops based on SiteGenesis.

## Test Suite Documentation

### Tests

The aim of our test set is to cover standard functions of the shop system. Every test simulates a shopping behaviour of a customer. Regarded closely a test even focuses on a specific part of the buying process which is tested in depth. This test focus describes several shop area in the package structrue in which tests are ordered. 

All tests cover a wide variety of different test pathes and are build up on script modules. Each test consists of test setup (ensuring that all preconditions are met), test scope (focusing on all relevant testing steps) and test teardown (cleaning up of changed data in your browser and reversing the state of the shop system to its origin).

### Modules

A script module contains actions, commands and comments. Each module interacts with elements of ta specifc webpage. Thus it makes sense to structured them by their accordnig pages. Each module can be reused by different tests.

#### Validation Modules

Validation of webpage elements and dynamic data is a very essential part of testing. Hence these special modules evalute that a needed fit criterion is met (mostly via assertions).

#### Flow Modules

Some modules mimic more sophisticated shopping behaviours by interacting with several pages in a flow. The achieved specific goal at the end of the process is of most importance (in contrast to the taken singular steps). Flows often reuse other modules and may enable a compact test case structure (implemented in setup, scope or teardown). Examples: Add any basic product to cart, Create any new customer, Add any address to a customer, Check order status in order history.
